F1 25 UDP Telemetry — Session Packet (753 bytes).

The session packet has embedded arrays (marshal zones, weather samples)
between scalar fields, so we split into three segments for decoding:

  PACKET_HEADER
  + SESSION_FIELDS_PRE_MARSHAL    (m_weather .. m_numMarshalZones)
  + MARSHAL_ZONE[21]
  + SESSION_FIELDS_MID            (m_safetyCarStatus .. m_numWeatherForecastSamples)
  + WEATHER_FORECAST_SAMPLE[64]
  + SESSION_FIELDS_POST           (m_forecastAccuracy .. m_sector3LapDistanceStart)
